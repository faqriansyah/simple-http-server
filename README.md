For development only, unless you enjoy pain.

Sometimes I just want to run an HTML file without summoning the holy trinity of VSCode + Live Server, Laragon, or XAMPP. Yes, I know those exist. No, I donâ€™t care. Too many clicks.

So I made this toy : a tiny HTTP server you can spin up anywhere in your folders. No htdocs, no launching IDEs, no rituals. Just serve and vibe.

# Why?
Because dragging a file into the browser and watching it scream about CORS isn't fun.


# What it does
- Runs an HTTP server where you are.
- No need to install bloated tools.
- No need to move stuff around like it's 2005.
